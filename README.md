# Taxi-Management-System-using-JADE
This project is a Java-based taxi management system developed using [JADE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Agent_Development_Framework) (Java Agent Development Framework).

## Introduction

The Taxi Management System is designed to simulate the operation of taxi drivers in a grid world. The project includes two versions: a single-agent package and a multi-agent package. In the single-agent system, you'll find a standalone taxi agent that operates independently to serve clients and maximize profits. This single-agent setup serves as the basis for the multi-agent variant, which introduces multiple taxi agents. In that system, the agents collaborate and communicate to efficiently serve clients, resolve conflicts, and optimize their payoffs. Coordination, planning, and negotiation become crucial aspects of the system, enabling a more sophisticated and realistic approach to taxi management.
